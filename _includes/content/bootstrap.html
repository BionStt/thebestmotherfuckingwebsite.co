      <p><a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> is a fucking godsend, and will actually handle the "cross-browser"
        and "responsive" bit for you, so that your lazy ass can focus on the Real Thing&trade;.</p>
      <p>Plus, it's got all of the fucking JavaScript you'll ever need. Fancy scrolling has never gotten this fancier. Click
        that icon on the header. I fucking dare you.</p>
